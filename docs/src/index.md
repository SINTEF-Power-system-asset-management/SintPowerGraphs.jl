# SintPowerGraphs.jl

Julia package for treating a power system as a graph.

The library is in very early development and probably only usable and useful for me. I expect the type hierarchy to undergo large changes as I learn Julia.

## Method documentation

```@index
Modules = [SintPowerGraphs]
```

```@autodocs
Modules = [SintPowerGraphs]
```
