# After we have loaded the case we can plot it using GraphPlot

# From the plot of the graph, we can see that the system can be easily split into two islands.

# We can now see that the system is split into two islands. The incidence matrix for this system is given below.

A = get_incidence_matrix(graph, true)

# A problem with this matrix is that when we try to do a dc power flow the determinant we must calculate will be zero. For the purpose of demonstrating this we assume bus 1 to be the reference bus.

B = get_dc_admittance_matrix(graph, true)
det(B[2:6, 2:6])

# To solve this problem it is useful to order the rows and columns of the incidence such that it becomes block diagonal with one block per island.

# Now we can easily invert the matrix contained in the block diagonal containing the reference bus.

b = get_susceptance_vector(graph, true)
# We have to remember to swap the position of the suceptances
